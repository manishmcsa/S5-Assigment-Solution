  
#1 Target

Model is created using Dropout,BatchNorm, Maxpooling and Gobal Average pooling.

#1 Results:
Parameters: 9.9k
Best Train Accuracy: 99.11
Best Test Accuracy: 99.19

#1 Analysis:
There is evidence of overfitting in some of the epochs in the models. 
Most of the time accuracy of training and test are close enough
last 2 pochs have accuracy as below :
  Epoch 14 - Training : 99.06 Test: 98.91 difference : 0.15
  Epoch 15 - Training : 99.11 Test: 99.19 difference : 0.08 (tst accuracy is high)
Looking at the accuracy if we increase the number of epochs we might get 99.4 accuracy
