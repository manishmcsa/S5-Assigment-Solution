#1 Target

Model is created using Dropout,BatchNorm, Maxpooling, Gobal Average pooling,  Image Rotation (transforms) and applying Learning rate.

#1 Results:
Parameters: 9.9k
Best Train Accuracy: 99.36
Best Test Accuracy: 99.46

#1 Analysis:
No evidence of overfitting model. Training accuracy is always less than test accuray in each epoch.
Most of the time accuracy of training and test are close enough
last 2 pochs have accuracy as below :
  Epoch 14 - Training : 99.40 Test: 99.42 difference : 0.02 (test accuracy is high)
  Epoch 15 - Training : 99.36 Test: 99.46 difference : 0.10 (test accuracy is high)
Last 5 epochs have accuracy of test data above 99.4
