#1 Target:

First model is created using BatchNorm, Maxpooling and Gobal Average pooling.

#1 Results:
Parameters: 7.1k
Best Train Accuracy: 98.95
Best Test Accuracy: 98.85

#1 Analysis:
There is evidence of overfitting in the models. Some of the epochs have high accuracy of training than test.
Most of the time are close enough
last 2 pochs have accuracy as below :
  Epoch 14 - Training : 98.91 Test: 98.85 difference : 0.06
  Epoch 15 - Training : 98.95 Test: 98.84 difference : 0.11
Looking at the accuracy if we increase the number of epochs we might get 99.4 accuracy
